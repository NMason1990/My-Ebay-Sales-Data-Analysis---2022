# Ebay Sales Data Analysis for 2022

For this project I have taken all sales data of transactions from my eBay store for 2022 and imported them. 
 I want to clean the csv, analyze and visualize the data to see my total gross sales per month for the year,total net sales per month, avg. sale price of items, total fees and shipping, and the density of where people are ordering from. I will be using pandas,matplotlib, and pyplot to accomplish this. 

 Explaination of code and what I used to complete requirements is in jupyter file in markdown cells. 

## Relevant Python Packages

Use the pip install -r requirements.txt command to install all of the Python modules and packages listed in your requirements.txt file.



## Read data in 

Read in data from a local csv,
excel file, json, or any other
file type. There are many
ways to do this, but using
Pandas read_ functions is
pretty easy. I did this in the first code cell

## Manipulate and Clean Data

1. Use built-in pandas or numpy
functions to do things like
remove 0’s and null values
where they don’t belong in
your dataset. 

2. Use custom functions or
lambdas to perform specific
operations to clean or manipulate your data, return
those values, then use them
in other parts of your project. 

## Analyze Data!

Do 5 basic calculations with
Pandas, like finding the
sum(), median(), mean(), or
mode() of a column. You
could divide two columns by
each other. You could
multiple a column by a
random integer. You could
use string operations and find
the most common letter in a
given entry. 

Use at least 5 different built-in
Python functions to find out
something about your data. If
you had a list for example,
finding the length of that list
with len(<list>) does tell us a
little bit about the data. 

## Visualize Data

Make 2 basic plots with
matplotlib, seaborn, or any
other kind of visualization
library that you think looks
interesting. 

## Interpret Data Graphical Output

Write markdown cells in
Jupyter explaining your
thought process and code. If
you make a few plots with
matplotlib, explain what the
reader is seeing and why you
chose to plot things that way.
